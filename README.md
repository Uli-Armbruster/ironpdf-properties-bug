# ironpdf-properties-bug
Demonstrates a bug in IronPDF v4 and v5
Solution to reproduce the bug in the current (v5.2) and former (v4.4) versions of IronPDF. Solution was created with VisualStudio 2017. I've used Xunit for testing.

Bug: There is no way to load an existing PDF and access its properties e.g. the page count.
